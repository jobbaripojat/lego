# Lego robot

As a school project we programmed a robot made of legos to follow a black line. The set used was Lego Mindstorms EV3.

The code was written in Java and as an IDE we used Eclipse.
Commits became skewed, because we opted to use an Eclipse addon called [Saros](https://www.saros-project.org/). Saros enables multiple users to edit in the same workspace and to work on the same piece of code.

Javadocs is included for full documentation.
