# lego

As a school project we programmed a robot made of legos to follow a black line. The code was written in Java and we as an IDE we used Eclipse.

Commits became skewed, because we opted to use an Eclipse addon called Saros. Saros enables multiple users to edit in the same workplace and to work on the same piece of code.
